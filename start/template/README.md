## How to add a new localsite page

For documentation in a collaborative repo or in your own website

1. Copy the current [index.html page from GitHub](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/blob/main/start/index.html) or use View Page Source. Another option is to just copy the localsite.js tag.
2. Add text to a README.md file adjacent to the copied index.html file. 
3. Optionally, [add Localsite parameters](../../) for locations (state and counties) and impact sets (air, water, land, energy, health, prosperity) to embed maps and visualizations [for local communities](/io/communities/) and [international goals](/data-commons/docs).

Also fork the [localsite repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite) and turn on GitHub Pages to view at https://[your account].github.io.
