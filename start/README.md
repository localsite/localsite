# Getting Started  

[View Community Pages](../../apps/)  
You can use these steps to create a website with free GitHub hosting

### The following can be used to host a custom page within the "apps" repo

1. First, fork the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite), the [apps repo](https://github.com/modelearth/apps), and the [io repo](https://github.com/modelearth/io).  Turn on [GitHub Pages](#github-pages) for each repo.  
After a few minutes, you can view your fork at [[your account].github.io/apps](https://modelearth.github.io/apps)  
2. Activate a webroot on your local computer at [http://localhost:8887](http://localhost:8887/)
3. Then [clone the three forked repos](#clone) into the same local webroot folder.
4. Copy the [base page folder](../../apps/base/) locally, change parameters and deploy your updates.
5. [Fetch upstream](#fetch-upstream) changes to your forked repos.
6. [Point a domain](#domain) at your repos (optional)

Here are details for the steps above...<br><br>


# Local Webroot Setup


<section id="github-pages"></section>

## 1. Fork repos and turn on Github Pages 

Clone forks of the parent repos so you can review your changes online before submitting a pull request (PR).  
Click the "Fork" button in the upper right of each of the following pages:   

[localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite)
[io repo](https://github.com/modelearth/io)
[apps repo](https://github.com/modelearth/apps)

Activate GitHub Pages for each of your forked repos by going to "Settings > Pages" and choosing "main" (or master) then save.

<div style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:15px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:20px">
<img src="img/github-pages.png">
</div>

IMPORTANT: DO NOT SELECT A THEME - The Jekyll theme will break the modular site integration.  

Wait a few minutes for a new GitHub Pages site to become available at a link in the following format:

https://[your account].Github.io/[repo name]  


## 2. Activate a webroot folder on your computer

The following will allow you to launch [http://localhost:8887/localsite/](http://localhost:8887/localsite/) to view multiple repos in the same webroot.

Go to the folder where you'd like your webroot to reside and run the following to view pages on localhost:  
Run this command to start localhost whenever you restart your computer.

	python -m http.server 8887

If that dose't work, here are more options for [activating your webroot](activate-webroot).


<section id="clone"></section>

## 3. Clone forked repos into your webroot

Now go to [your list of forked repos](https://github.com/modelearth?tab=repositories) and clone the forked repos listed above.

To clone, click the green "Code" button followed by "Open in GitHub Desktop."

Save the clone in the webroot folder you created in step 1.  

A static page should now be visible at [http://localhost:8887/localsite/](http://localhost:8887/localsite/)  

Also clone the <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/io/'>io repo</a> into the same webroot to include the input-output widgets. [Learn more](../../../io/charts/)    

Also clone the <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/apps/'>apps repo</a> if you are making a custom page.  

To redirect into a repo, you can place an index.html file in your webroot with the following:  

	<script language="JavaScript">window.location="localsite/"</script>


## 4. Deploy your updates

Deploy your updates using GitHub. If you are not a project collaborator, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to create a project fork on GitHub. Place a pull request when your updates are ready for review.  

<!--
- <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/io'>io</a> - overview
- <a href='https://github.com/georgiadata/smartdata'>smartdata</a> - data

A 404 error will occur for the private smartdata folder if you are not a collaborator. 
-->

<!--
## 4. Update markdown pages

Add notes and links in the README.md files which are pulled into index.html pages.  

- [Bioeconomy Planner - BEA](../../bea)  
- [Industry Impact](../../industries)  
- [Localization - Places](../../places)  
-->

<!--
## 5. Update dataset layouts

Use a Google Sheet or CSV file to [prototype a list or chart](../dataset) and update [EEIO Widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts/) that load from JSON files generated by the USEEIO API.  
-->

<!--
1. [Set up crowdsourced editing](../../../crowdsource/editor) of data for lists and maps.

1. Copy the "starter" folder inside community and give it the name of your community or module.
-->


**Mac Users:** To avoid commiting your local .DS\_Store files to GitHub, you can run the following to ignore .DS\_Store files during commits forever. The .DS\_Store files will continue to set icon sizes in your local file manager.   
 
<!-- Avoid .DS_Store file creation over network connections (article from 2011, confirm this still occurs)
	https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1629 -->
	git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore  
	echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore

If you encounter the error "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path", [install the Xcode toolkit](https://ma.ttias.be/mac-os-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-missing-xcrun/) first.  

You can view hidden files by toggling Command+Shift+Dot. Note that .DS_Store will not be displayed.<br>
To fix a conflict you may need delete the .DS_Store within the Github.com website.  


<section id="fetch-upstream"></section>

## 5. Fetch upstream changes to your forked repos

Occasionally merge in updates from parent repos by clicking "Fetch Upstream > Fetch and Merge" in GitHub.

<!--
In the old days you had to do the following:

- On your forked repo: Click Compare 
- Flip the order. (Pick a third repo temporarily because if the two match a warning occurs.)
- Create pull request > Give the pull request a title 
- Create pull request (again) 
- Merge pull request (scroll down) > Confirm merge.

-->

<section id="domain"></section>

## 6. Point a domain at your repos (optional)

You can point a domain at all the repos in your Github account with the steps below.  


- Use CloudFlare.com as a free proxy for your domain name - [setup steps](cloudflare/) - [more about Cloudflare with GitHub](https://www.toptal.com/github/unlimited-scale-web-hosting-github-pages-cloudflare). AWS can also be used.  
- Important: If you are using the same domain for Google email accounts, avoid adding the 4 Google A records (these prevent adding the CNAME record). You'll only need to add the 5 MX records provided by Google.  
- Create a repo in your primary account matching the name of the account: [github username].github.io  
- Click settings and activate GitHub Pages for your [github username].github.io and each repo that is a subfolder in your site.  
- Add your custom domain name to the root repo called [github username].github.io.  
- Add a CNAME record for your domain in CloudFlare with @ and [secondary github username].github.io. Using a secondary GitHub username allows more than one repo folder to be accessible through your primary domain.   

- Wait 2 to 10 minutes for new GitHub Pages site to become available.
- Activate GitHub Pages for each additional repo residing within the primary account. These can be forks from other accounts.  
- Avoid putting referenced files in your [github username].github.io root repo because it won't be the root of your site when you view on localhost.  
- Fork the "[localsite](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/)" repo into your GitHub account if you'd like to include it's functionality in any of your sites. Turn on GitHub pages to display at YourDomain.com/localsite/
