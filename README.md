## Input-Output Widgets

Creating websites should be fun - without waiting for build commands.  The&nbsp;[localsite&nbsp;repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/) provides a static framework for displaying community data from fast&nbsp;json&nbsp;APIs, Google Sheets, and .CSV files in our <a href="https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/" target="_parent">community data repo</a>.
