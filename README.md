Creating websites should be fun - without waiting for build commands.  The [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/) provides a static framework for displaying community data from fast json APIs and .csv files in our <a href="https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/" target="_parent">community data repo</a>.
